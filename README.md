# BigMe

This is a simple diary style application I built to document daily struggles as parents of a children with ASD. This is meant to be an outlet as well as something to document how things are progressing.

## Installation

Clone down the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/dcoppage86/big-me.git
cd big-me
```
Once in the project directory, use two terminals in your editor to open the backend and frontend

For backend
```
cd big-me-backend
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```
With the rails server running you will open the index.html file in your browser.

For frontend
```
cd big-me-frontend
open index.html
```
